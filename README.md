*The app on first launch: enter an OpenAI API key in the sidebar, upload financial PDFs, and start asking questions.*

## Overview

Financial documents (10-Ks, earnings call transcripts, analyst reports) are dense and time-consuming to parse. This app lets you **upload any PDF and ask questions in natural language** — getting precise, source-cited answers in seconds.

### Key Features
- **Multi-document ingestion** — upload multiple PDFs simultaneously
- **Semantic vector search** — ChromaDB indexes document chunks with MMR retrieval for diverse, relevant results
- **Conversational memory** — maintains context across multiple questions (sliding window of last 5 turns)
- **Source citations** — every answer shows which document and page it came from
- **Financial-domain system prompt** — tuned for precise financial data extraction (numbers, dates, ratios)
- **Dark-themed UI** — clean chat interface with styled message bubbles and source chips

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kantamaniprakash/financial-rag-chatbot.git
cd financial-rag-chatbot
```

### 2. Install dependencies

With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended — uses the committed lockfile):
```bash
uv sync
```

Or with pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 4. Enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar and upload documents

---

## Usage

1. Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser
2. Enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar
3. Upload one or more financial PDF documents
4. Click **"Process Documents"** — the app chunks, embeds, and indexes them in ChromaDB
5. Type your question in the chat input
6. Get answers with source citations (file name + page number)

### Example Questions
- *"What was Apple's revenue growth YoY in Q3?"*
- *"Summarize the key risk factors mentioned in this 10-K"*
- *"What did the CEO say about AI strategy in the earnings call?"*
- *"Compare the gross margins between the two uploaded reports"*
- *"What are the major capital expenditure items mentioned?"*

## How It Works

1. **PDF Ingestion** — PyMuPDF reads uploaded PDFs from bytes (no temp files needed), extracts text page-by-page with metadata (source file, page number)
2. **Chunking** — a sentence-aware chunker (`chunking.py`) packs whole sentences into chunks of at most 256 tokens, measured with the embedding model's own tokenizer (cl100k_base), so chunk boundaries never cut through a sentence mid-thought (see [Chunking configuration](#chunking-configuration-and-why) for why)
3. **Embedding** — OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` converts chunks into dense vectors
4. **Indexing** — ChromaDB stores vectors in a persistent local database for fast similarity search
5. **Retrieval** — MMR retrieval fetches top-5 most relevant and diverse chunks from a candidate pool of 15
6. **Generation** — GPT-4o-mini generates answers grounded in retrieved context, with a financial-domain system prompt enforcing citation and precision
7. **Memory** — Sliding window keeps last 5 conversation turns for multi-turn follow-up questions

## Chunking configuration (and why)

The chunking defaults are not folklore — they come from
[rag-chunking-bench](https://github.com/kantamaniprakash/genai-lab/tree/main/rag-chunking-bench),
my controlled benchmark of chunking strategies that compares chunkers under a
**matched retrieved-token budget** (so bigger chunks don't win just by handing
the LLM more text) with paired bootstrap confidence intervals.

**Defaults: sentence-packed chunks of ≤ 256 tokens, no overlap, tokens counted
with cl100k_base (the embedding model's own tokenizer).**

What the benchmark measured that motivates each choice:

- **Sentence packing over character/window splitting.** Chunkers that only cut
  at sentence boundaries beat fixed token windows at every matched size on the
  benchmark's short-answer dataset, and at the size this app uses the gap was
  largest on long-reference corpora (including a corpus of financial
  documents): **+0.083 SpanRecall** at 256 tokens and a 400-token retrieval
  budget — cutting mid-sentence cuts through exactly the evidence the
  retriever needs.
- **256 tokens, not smaller.** This app retrieves k=5 chunks of ≤ 256 tokens
  (≈ 1,000–1,300 tokens of context), which is the benchmark's generous-budget
  regime. There, on corpora whose answers span whole sentences or paragraphs
  (like financial filings), sentence-256 was the **top configuration of all 12
  tested** (SpanRecall 0.845 at an 800-token budget, 0.938 at 1,600), and the
  popular "smaller chunks are always better" rule inverted: 64-token chunks
  scored significantly *worse* than 256 (−0.040 [−0.063, −0.018] at B=1,600).
  Small chunks only win when answers are short spans and budgets are tight.
- **No overlap.** At 256-token sentence packing, overlap of 1–2 sentences
  moved recall by a statistically insignificant −0.014 to +0.010 while
  inflating the index by 21–44% more chunks. Overlap earns its cost only for
  *fixed windows* (where it repairs broken boundaries) or small sentence
  chunks — sentence packing at this size already gets that benefit for free.

**Caveats, honestly stated:** the benchmark measured retrieval (span recall of
gold evidence), not end-to-end answer quality; its budgets are in regex word
tokens while this app budgets cl100k BPE tokens (~same regime, not identical
units); and its retrievers were BM25/TF-IDF/LSA/MiniLM rather than
`text-embedding-3-small`. The findings transferred across all four retriever
families whose encoders read the full chunk — which an 8K-context OpenAI
embedder does — but I have not yet re-run the grid with OpenAI embeddings.

## Results

**What is measured.** The repo ships an evaluation harness (`eval_harness.py`, see
[Evaluation](#evaluation)) that scores the retriever and the generator as separate components
against a committed fixture corpus (10 synthetic financial passages) and a labeled eval set
(10 questions with known-relevant chunks and expected facts):

| Component | Metric | Method |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Retriever | Hit Rate@k | fraction of questions with a relevant chunk in the top-k |
| Retriever | MRR@k | mean reciprocal rank of the first relevant chunk |
| Generator | Faithfulness | LLM-judge pass/fail: is the answer grounded in retrieved context? |
| Generator | Answer relevancy | LLM-judge 1–5 score for how directly the answer addresses the question |
| Generator | Keyword coverage | sanity check that expected facts appear in the answer |

**What is not claimed.** No benchmark numbers are published in this repo: running the harness
requires an OpenAI API key, and its output (`eval_results.json`) is deliberately not committed
so stale numbers never drift out of sync with the code. Qualitative observations from
development — sub-second retrieval on ~50-page PDFs, ChromaDB comfortably indexing 100+ page
collections on a single laptop — are anecdotal, not benchmarked.

### Limitations

- **Synthetic eval corpus** — the harness's 10-passage fixture set is small and synthetic; scores on it do not guarantee performance on real 10-Ks or earnings transcripts.
- **LLM-judge subjectivity** — faithfulness and relevancy are scored by an LLM judge, which carries its own biases and run-to-run variance.
- **No hallucination guarantee** — the system prompt enforces grounding and citation, but LLM outputs can still contain unsupported statements; citations identify retrieved chunks, not independently verified facts.
- **API cost and dependency** — every indexed chunk and every question incurs OpenAI embedding/completion calls; there is no local-model fallback.
- **Single-machine scale, text PDFs only** — ChromaDB runs embedded with local persistence (no auth, no multi-user serving), and PyMuPDF extracts embedded text only, so scanned/image-based PDFs need OCR that is not included.

## Evaluation

`eval_harness.py` evaluates the retriever and the generator as separate
components, which is the current best practice for debugging RAG systems —
it tells you whether a bad answer came from the retriever surfacing the
wrong chunks or the LLM misusing good ones.

It ships with its own fixture corpus (10 synthetic financial passages) and
a labeled eval set (10 questions with known-relevant chunks and expected
facts), so it runs standalone against a fresh in-memory Chroma store —
no uploaded PDFs required.

**Retrieval metrics**
- **Hit Rate@k** — fraction of questions where a relevant chunk is in the top-k results
- **MRR@k** — mean reciprocal rank of the first relevant chunk

**Generation metrics**
- **Faithfulness** — LLM-judge pass/fail on whether the answer is grounded in the retrieved context
- **Answer relevancy** — LLM-judge 1-5 score for how directly the answer addresses the question
- **Keyword coverage** — sanity check that expected facts appear in the answer

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
python eval_harness.py            # k=5 by default
python eval_harness.py --k 3 --output results.json
```

This prints a summary report plus a per-question pass/fail breakdown, and
writes full results (including every generated answer and judge reasoning)
to `eval_results.json`.

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add support for Excel/CSV financial data ingestion
- [ ] Implement reranking with Cohere Rerank API for improved precision
- [ ] Add financial-specific analysis templates (DCF, ratio analysis, peer comparison)
- [ ] Support for EDGAR API direct 10-K/10-Q downloads
- [ ] Deploy to Streamlit Cloud or AWS EC2
