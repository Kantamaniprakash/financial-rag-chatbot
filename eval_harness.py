"""
RAG Evaluation Harness
=======================
Component-level evaluation for the Financial RAG Chatbot's retrieval and
generation stages, evaluated separately so failures can be attributed to
the right part of the pipeline.

Retrieval metrics (does the retriever surface the right chunks?):
  - Hit Rate@k  — fraction of questions where a relevant chunk appears in the top-k
  - MRR@k       — mean reciprocal rank of the first relevant chunk

Generation metrics (given good context, does the model answer well?):
  - Faithfulness   — LLM-judge score (0-1) for whether the answer is grounded
                      in the retrieved context, with no unsupported claims
  - Answer Relevancy — LLM-judge score (1-5) for how directly the answer
                      addresses the question

The harness ships with its own fixture corpus and labeled eval set, so it
runs standalone against a fresh in-memory vector store — no uploaded PDFs
required.

Usage:
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    python eval_harness.py
    python eval_harness.py --k 3 --output results.json
